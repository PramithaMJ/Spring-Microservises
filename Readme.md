# SpringBoot Microservises


## Technologies Used

- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Provides a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross-cutting concerns such as security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency.

- **Eureka Discovery Client**: A REST-based service for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.

- **OpenFeign**: Declarative REST Client. OpenFeign creates a dynamic implementation of an interface decorated with JAX-RS or Spring MVC annotations.

- **Spring Web**: Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.

- **Spring Data JPA**: Persist data in SQL stores with Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate.

- **PostgreSQL Driver**: A JDBC and R2DBC driver that allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database-independent Java code.

- **Lombok**: Java annotation library which helps to reduce boilerplate code.

- **Spring Boot DevTools**: Provides fast application restarts, LiveReload, and configurations for an enhanced development experience.
